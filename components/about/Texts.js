        history, like treating’s in the past, reports, test results and any
        other documents about her/his possible current conditions for the
        preliminary diagnosis. After we received all the documents from the
        patient, we arrange and share them with our contracted doctors. The most
        appropriate treatment and medical procedures for the patient, prepared
        in detail by our physicians, will be transferred to our professional
        planning team. The patient receives a detailed treatment plan, the
        medical procedures and a price offer prepared by the health care team.
        The patient decides which services she / he wants to take. The
        appointments with the doctors for the pre-checks are organized by our
        team after the health visa is approved. Airline tickets will be bought
        according to the travel plan. The selected hotel will be booked by our
        planning team. Airport transfer is done by our transfer agent on the
